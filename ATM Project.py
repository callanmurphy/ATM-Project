#ATM Project â€“ Callan Murphy
#01/04/2019
#Bonus 1 and 2 Completed
'''
NOTE on Bonuses: The program will save a card number and PIN number,
storing a single user's account. It will save 3 balances for checking,
savings and investments (3 individual sub-accounts within the main one)
and one overall overdraft amount to be used by all 3 of the sub-accounts.
(For example, if a user creates an account, ending the program with a
balance of $0 in checking, $567.33 in savings, $250.87 in investments,
and $600.00 in overdraft, when they restart the program and sign into
their accout, those values will be the same).
'''

'''  
Our ATM program begins by asking to user if they wish to create an account.
If they have created an account previously, they can input 'no' and sign in
with their previous details (Bonus 1/2). Otherwise, an account must be created.
